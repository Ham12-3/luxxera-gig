# Image & Background Pattern Guide for Patient Confidence Hub

## Background Pattern Recommendations

### Recommended: Subtle Grid Pattern
**Description**: A professional, subtle grid overlay on the dark green gradient background. The grid consists of very thin, semi-transparent lines (about 1px) in a slightly lighter shade of the dark green. The grid cells should be approximately 60px x 60px, creating a structured, organized feel without being distracting.

**Visual Effect**: 
- Creates a sense of precision and organization (perfect for medical/healthcare)
- Adds subtle texture without overwhelming the content
- Maintains the dark green theme while adding depth
- The grid should be barely visible - more of a texture than a prominent pattern

**Color**: Use `hsl(180 20% 15%)` - a very subtle, slightly lighter version of the base dark green

**Why it works**: Medical applications benefit from clean, organized layouts. The grid suggests precision, structure, and professionalism - all important for building patient confidence.

### Alternative Option 1: Dot Mesh Pattern
**Description**: A subtle dot pattern where small dots (1-2px) are arranged in a regular grid, spaced about 40px apart. The dots should be very faint, almost like a fine mesh or screen texture.

**Visual Effect**: 
- Modern, tech-forward feel
- Adds texture without lines
- Suggests scientific precision
- Less structured than grid, more organic

---

### Alternative Option 2: Hexagonal Pattern
**Description**: A honeycomb/hexagonal grid pattern with very thin outlines. Each hexagon should be about 100px wide. The pattern should be extremely subtle, almost imperceptible.

**Visual Effect**: 
- Medical/scientific theme (like cells or molecular structures)
- Unique and modern
- Suggests innovation and technology
- Can be more noticeable than grid, so use very low opacity

---

### Alternative Option 3: Organic Wave Pattern
**Description**: Gentle, flowing wave lines that curve softly across the background. Multiple layers of waves at different opacities create depth. Waves should be horizontal and very subtle.

**Visual Effect**: 
- Calming and soothing (good for patient anxiety)
- Suggests flow and healing
- Less clinical, more human-centered
- Can feel more premium and spa-like
